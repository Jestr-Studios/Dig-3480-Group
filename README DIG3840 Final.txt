1. What are your modifications you made to the game?

I made the produced the background music for the game as well as added in and coded a new enemy.

2. What's the biggest challenge you have so far?

Coding the new enemy was frustrating as for a while it was not registering as an object in the game that would cue the death scene. It took some time to figure out but it worked out in the end.

3. Will you continue working on this assignment? If yes, what might be some changes you will add later?

I personally will not, but I will use what I have learned here to work on another personal project I am passionate about.

1. What are your modifications you made to the game?

Helped produce code for hit box and triggers in end of game, as well as creating prefab.

2. What's the biggest challenge you have so far?

Figuring out to configure the new enemy as a prefab and establishing it to the game end took way too long to figure out.

3. Will you continue working on this assignment? If yes, what might be some changes you will add later?

I will not as it does not fit my passion for what I want out of a game but will use lessons I learned from it.
